## Development

### Requirements

Qt5.2+ with qmake

### Building

qmake

### Roadmap

- 1.1+ add eth support
- 1.0 add geth account backup and restore
- 0.9 add transaction history support
- 0.8 initial release [done]

### Caveats & bugs

Only supported client is at the moment is Geth. Eth and others should work if you go to settings and set the IPC path/name properly. Not tested.
Currently doesn't support getting transaction history. If someone knows how to get it for an account from block #0 I'm all ears.
